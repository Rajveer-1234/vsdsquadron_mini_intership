# TASK 2
Add description for each image. Identify instruction type and exact 32-bit instruction code in 
the instruction type format.  

## RISC-V ISA: 
The RISC-V ISA, which stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing is an open standard 
instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computing 
principles. It's designed to be modular, scalable, and customizable, making it suitable for a 
wide range of applications, from embedded systems to supercomputers. RISC-V is gaining 
popularity due to its open nature, which fosters innovation and collaboration across various 
industries and academic institutions. It offers different standard extensions to accommodate 
diverse computing requirements, such as integer, floating-point, vector, cryptographic, and 
more.

1. R-Type
2. I-Type
3. S-Type
4. B-Type
5. U-Type
6. J-Type
